This project is based on the tiny ray caster tutorial from https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraycast

TODO list:
	- figure out what the hell I want to do with the enemy rendering
		- start with just getting the math in?
	- consolidate player state signals
	- add proper levels using nodes to represent enemies/walls
		- skull_enemy.tscn is kind of a start to this
